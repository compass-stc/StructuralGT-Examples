    "## Interacting with network images using *StructuralGT*'s `Network` class\n",
    "*StructuralGT* interacts with images of networks via the `Network` class. Before using the `Network` class, you must first ensure your network images are laid out in your directory appropriately. Network images may be either a single image from which you would like to extract a two-dimensional (2D) network or it may be a stack of 2D images which represent a three-dimensional (3D) network. In either case, when using *StructuralGT*, **each material network must be stored in itâ€™s own directory.** Let's look at some examples of how the `Network` class behaves given a particular file system layouts and constructor arguments.\n",
