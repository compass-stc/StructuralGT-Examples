# StructuralGT examples

Welcome to the StructuralGT example scripts.
These Jupyter notebooks demonstrate how to use StructuralGT and may be downloaded and run on your own system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlainKadar/StructuralGT-Examples.git
cd StructuralGT-Examples
jupyter notebook
```

You will need to [install](https://jupyter.org/install) jupyter notebook, if you do not have it already. See their [tutorials](https://jupyter.org/try) if you are new to Jupyter.
